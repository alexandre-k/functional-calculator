# Functional calculator

This is a calculator written in Python. It is written in a functional style,
inspired by Haskell for the type IO, which represents the IO monad for side effects.

The operators are only the basic ones, +, -, /, *.

The program is used as my answer for an assignment in a CS course at
the University of People.
